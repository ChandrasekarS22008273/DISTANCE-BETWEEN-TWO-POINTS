# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
Get the two values from the user

## Step 2:
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable

## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

## Step 4:
Print distance

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
